What is Axios ? 
    - Axios is a package . 
    - Used for : Instead of sending api request using postman
      Axios is used .

After adding a package , always do npm start . 
Because when you install a package , the package.json file is updated.
So, in order to update that we use "npm start"

What does "npm start" do ?
- So npm start runs the node script that is listed under start in the package.json.

After installing a package , How to use that package ?
- Once u install the package , that appears in package.json file
- To use the package , we have to export that package in the file where we want to
  use it.
  Eg : If i install axios using " npm install axios " in package.json , you can find
  axios . Now want to use axios , so you can use it by using " import axios from "axios"

What is React Props ?
- React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
Eg: Here "title" is used as attribute in App.js and "title" is used as
    function parameter in Row.js [Row.js is a component ]

    function App() {
      return (
          <div className="App">
              <h1> Hey clever programmer</h1>
              <Row title="NETFLIX ORIGINALS"></Row>
              <Row title="TRENDING NOW"> </Row>
          </div>
      );
    }
function Row( { title }){
  return (
          <div>
            <h2>{ title }</h2>
            {/* title */}

            {/* container -> posters */}

          </div>
  )
}

What is a state ?
  - State is a sort term memory. When we refresh it disappears. 
    Good place to store some information. It is basically a way to write variables
    in react . 

what is template literal ?
- Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (` `) (grave accent) character 
  instead of double or single quotes. Template literals can contain placeholders. 
  These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}). 
  The expressions in the placeholders and the text between the backticks (` `) 
  get passed to a function. The default function just concatenates the parts into a single string. 
  If there is an expression preceding the template literal (tag here), this is called a tagged template.

Eg : 
      const API_KEY = "3ada5264adeb01bb2e3c75995d4b245e"

      const requests = {
          fetchTrending: `/top_rated?api_key=${API_KEY}&language=en-US&page=1`
      }
