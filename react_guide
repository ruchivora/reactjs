What is Axios ? 
    - Axios is a package . 
    - Used for : Instead of sending api request using postman
      Axios is used .

After adding a package , always do npm start . 
Because when you install a package , the package.json file is updated.
So, in order to update that we use "npm start"

What does "npm start" do ?
- So npm start runs the node script that is listed under start in the package.json.

After installing a package , How to use that package ?
- Once u install the package , that appears in package.json file
- To use the package , we have to export that package in the file where we want to
  use it.
  Eg : If i install axios using " npm install axios " in package.json , you can find
  axios . Now want to use axios , so you can use it by using " import axios from "axios"

What is React Props ?
- React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
Eg: Here "title" is used as attribute in App.js and "title" is used as
    function parameter in Row.js [Row.js is a component ]

    function App() {
      return (
          <div className="App">
              <h1> Hey clever programmer</h1>
              <Row title="NETFLIX ORIGINALS"></Row>
              <Row title="TRENDING NOW"> </Row>
          </div>
      );
    }
function Row( { title }){
  return (
          <div>
            <h2>{ title }</h2>
            {/* title */}

            {/* container -> posters */}

          </div>
  )
}

What is a state ?
  - State is a sort of temporary memory. When we refresh it disappears. 
    Good place to store some information. It is basically a way to write variables
    in react . 

what is template literal ?
- Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (` `) (grave accent) character 
  instead of double or single quotes. Template literals can contain placeholders. 
  These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}). 
  The expressions in the placeholders and the text between the backticks (` `) 
  get passed to a function. The default function just concatenates the parts into a single string. 
  If there is an expression preceding the template literal (tag here), this is called a tagged template.

Eg : 
      const API_KEY = "3ada5264adeb01bb2e3c75995d4b245e"

      const requests = {
          fetchTrending: `/top_rated?api_key=${API_KEY}&language=en-US&page=1`
      }

Types of exports in reactjs 

The export statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export objects, 
functions, variables from the module so they can be used by other programs with 
the help of the import statements.There are two types of exports. One is Named 
Exports and other is Default Exports.

- Named Exports: Named exports are useful to export several values. 
  During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.

Eg: //file math.js 

      function square(x) { 
      return x * x; 
      } 
      function cube(x) { 
      return x * x; 
      } 
      export { square, cube }; 


      //while importing square function in test.js 
      import { square, cube } from './math; 
      console.log(square(8)) //64 
      console.log(cube(8)) //512 

- Default Exports: Default exports are useful to export only a single object, 
  function, variable. During the import, we can use any name to import.
 
  Eg: // file module.js 
      var x=4; 
      export default x; 

      // test.js 
      // while importing x in test.js 
      import y from './module'; 
      // note that y is used import x instead of 
      // import x, because x was default export 
      console.log(y);		 
      // output will be 4
